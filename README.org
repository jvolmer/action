* Milestones

** Can compute magnetization
- [X] Can do a Metropolis step on one spin
- [X] Can do Metropolis steps on each spin on a lattice to generate a configuration
- [X] Can compute magnetization on one configuration
- [ ] Can compute magnetization on full set of configurations (including uncertainty)

** Can read and write configuration files and use them for computation of magnetization
- [ ] Can write one lattice configuration to a file
- [ ] Can read configuration from file
- [ ] Can compute magnetization from a set of configuration files

** Uses actor model for computation of magnetization from configuration files
- [ ] Include proper actor library
- [ ] Worker actor can read one configuration and compute magnetization on it
- [ ] Manger actor can distributes work onto workers and computes resulting magnetization
